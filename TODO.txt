Frame debugger:
Needs to be enabled and haults default rendering.
Each call to GL:: also keeps track of the state of the renderer.

Shader properties:
Shaders will have a PROPERTIES field at the top, indicating which uniforms can be modified.
Will require a rewrite of all shaders to include this field. bummer.

Finish porting to OGL 3.3, using the old-school buffer binding...
